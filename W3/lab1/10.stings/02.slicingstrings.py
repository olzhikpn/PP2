#1.Slicing

#You can return a range of characters by using the slice syntax.

#Example 1
a = "Hello, Python!"
print(a[1:3])

#2.Slice From the Start

#By leaving out the start index, the range will start at the first character:

#Example 1
a = "Hello, Python!"
print(a[:4])

#3.Slice To the End

#By leaving out the end index, the range will go to the end:

#Example 1
a = "Hello, Python!"
print(a[3:])

#4.Negative Indexing

#Use negative indexes to start the slice from the end of the string:

#Example 1
a = "Hello, Python!"
print(a[-6:-1])
