#1.Creating Variables

#Example 1
x = 1
y = "Apple"
print(x)
print(y)

#Example 2
x = 2        # x is of type int
x = "Banana" # x is now of type str
print(x)

#2.Casting

#Example 1
x = str(4)    # x will be '4'
y = int(4)    # y will be 4
z = float(4)  # z will be 4.0

#3.Get the Type

#You can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.

#Example 1
x = 5
y = "John"
print(type(x))
print(type(y))

#4.Single or Double Quotes?

#You can use both variants.

#Example 1
x = "Apple"
# is the same as
x = 'Apple'

#5.Case-Sensitive

#Example 1
a = 3
A = "Apple"
#A will not overwrite a
